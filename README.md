# Creating a Docker Workflow
This project creates a simple Python app, sets up a virtual environment & installs the required dependencies.

It then tests & lints the code for both the app and the container.

It has the functionality to validate the circleci config file, and run a local circleci build to simulate the actual CircleCI cloud environment.

CircleCI automates the setup and linting processes, and will be updated to automate the testing.
